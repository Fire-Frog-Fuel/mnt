# mnt
This is the name of a python project where we attempt to transfer data between a server and a client using the socket library. Using this we made a functioning ,terminal based, chat room.
It is intended to be used only locally as there are many security issues.

To make it work download the files on two separate devices and edit the ips so they are the same in the client and server file. Run one device as server and as many as you want for clients.

You may encounter errors :3
